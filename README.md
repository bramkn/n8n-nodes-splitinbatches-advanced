# n8n-nodes-splitinbatches-advanced

This is an n8n community node. It gives you an extra output of the split in batches node. 
This path will be taken when the split in batches node is done with its loop of batches. It also gives you the option to combine all the results from batches before continuing on this "Done" path. 

If you want to use this node as a normal split in batches node that is possible, simply don't add an output to the Done path.
